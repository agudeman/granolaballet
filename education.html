                        <h2>Valencia College</h2>
                            I am excited to be enrolled in the Digital Media Design program at Valencia College, <br>
                            where I am pursuing my Associate of Science in Web Development. With this degree, I am <Br>
                            looking forward to gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to create innovative <br>
                            and engaging digital media designs. <Br>
                            <Br>
                            My education in web design has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I started out with <br>
                            a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and have since expanded my knowledge to include <Br>
                            JavaScript. I am also learning about the principles of web design, such as usability, accessibility, <Br>
                            and responsive design.<Br>
                            <br>
                            I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from creating simple websites to <br>
                            developing complex web applications. I have learned how to use different tools and frameworks to <Br>
                            create websites that are both visually appealing and functional. I have also gained experience in <Br>
                            creating user interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use.<Br>
                            <br>
                            My education in web design has also taught me the importance of staying up to date with the latest <Br>
                            trends and technologies. I am learning how to use the latest frameworks and libraries to create modern <br>
                            websites that are optimized for performance and scalability. I also am gaining an understanding of how <Br>
                            to use analytics to track user behavior and optimize websites for better user experience.<Br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, my education in web design has been a valuable experience. I have gained a wealth of knowledge <Br>
                            and experience that I can use to create websites that are both visually appealing and functional. I am <Br>
                            confident that my education in web design will continue to serve me well in the future.<br>
