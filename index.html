                            I am Ashlee Gudeman, a proud resident of the vibrant city <br>
                            of Orlando, Florida, where I have been living for the past <br>
                            few years and have come to call it my home. (Unfortunately) <Br>
                            As an aspiring Web Developer, I am excited to be enrolled in <Br>
                            the Digital Media Technology for Web Development program at <Br>
                            Valencia College, where I am eager to learn the skills and <Br>
                            knowledge necessary to become a successful Web Developer. In <br>
                            my spare time, I enjoy creating digital art as a hobby and have <br>
                            even had an Etsy shop where I was able to share my artwork with <br>
                            the world and make a few sales.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently employed by Universal Studios Florida as an Attractions <br>
                            Attendant for Transformers: The Ride 3D and Hagrids Magical Creatures <br>
                            Motorbike Adventure, and I am eager to take my career to the next level. <br>
                            With my experience in customer service and my passion for web design, I <Br>
                            am determined to pursue an internship with Universal that will allow <br>
                            me to combine my skills and interests in a meaningful way.<Br>
                            <Br>
                            When I am not working or going to school I enjoy hanging out with my two sons <Br>
                            and playing soccer with groups of friends. We love adventures and trying <Br>
                            new things.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am an outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded individual who is able to <Br>
                            effectively communicate with others and adjust to changes with ease. I <br>
                            am a firm believer that one should never stop striving to improve their <br>
                            professional skills and knowledge, and should always be open to learning <br>
                            new things.
