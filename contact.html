                            If you have any questions or would like to inquire about commissioning me for a project, please don't <br>
                            hesitate to get in touch - I'm always happy to hear from you!<Br>
                            <br>
                            I would be more than happy to provide you with a quote for your project, along with a brief explanation of <Br>
                            the scope of the work that needs to be done.<Br>
                            <Br>
                            I am a beginner with experience working on commissions, from simple illustrations to complex website designs. <br>
                            I'm also able to create custom icons, avatars, and emojis, and I'm particularly passionate about creating <Br>
                            portraits, cartoons, and landscapes. To ensure accuracy, I always require a detailed description or reference <Br>
                            image for each project.<Br>
                            <Br>
                            In addition to offering layout services for websites, I specialize in creating one- or two-page website designs <Br>
                            that are tailored to the clients' needs. The client is responsible for hosting the event, taking on the important <br>
                            task of ensuring that all of the necessary components are in place for a successful gathering.<Br>
                            <br>
                            Typically, commissions take about a month to complete without a specific timeline, but I strive to make the process <br>
                            as efficient and stress-free as possible. To ensure that I'm meeting the client's expectations, I stay in close contact <br>
                            with them, providing regular progress reports and asking questions when necessary. This way, I'm able to keep the project <Br>
                            on track and deliver a high-quality product in a timely manner.<br>
                            <br>

                            I appreciate your interest and thank you for taking the time to reach out!
